    A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<b><span style="color:darkblue"><sup>[1]</sup></span></b>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons,<br>
    bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,<br>
    boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and<br>
    spacecraft.<b><span style="color:darkblue"><sup>[2]</sup></span></b>
