<h1 style="color: darkblue;"><b>Romeo and Juliet</b></h1>
<h3 style="color: lightslategrey;"><b>ACT 1</b></h3>
<h3 style="color: lightslategrey;"><b>PROLOGUE</b></h3>

<div>
    Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
    The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
</div>

<h3 style="color: lightslategrey;"><b>SCENE I. Verona. A public place</b></h3>
<span>
    <i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>
</span>
<h3 style="color: lightslategrey;"><b>SAMPSON</b></h3>
<span>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</span>
<h3 style="color: lightslategrey;"><b>GREGORY</b></h3>
<span>
No, for then we should be colliers.
